## How this repo works
This is a boilerplate project for building React modules and publishing to [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com).

This boilerplate comes with a develop environment set up with [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/) for fast development and testing.

Here you can find instructions and guidelines for building components for existing modules or to create your new module from scratch.
